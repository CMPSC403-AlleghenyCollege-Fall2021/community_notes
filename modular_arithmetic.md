# Activity 12

## For each function, add a formula to calculate `mod` and an example with numbers.

## Team 1 (front): NAMES

Addition/substraction/multiplication

## Team 2 (back window): NAMES

Division/inverse

Done through the Extended Euclidean Algorithm: x^-1 is like asking x * y = 1 (mod n).  We need something that maps "x" back to the identity element, 1.  This is x^-1, and the equation is solved through the EEA, not just dividing 1 by x, like it may seem at first glance.  So, x^-1 will equal y in the formula above.

## Team 3 (back wall): NAMES

Exponentiation
