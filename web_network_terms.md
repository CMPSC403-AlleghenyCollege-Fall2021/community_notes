# Reflection Quiz 12

## Security Charades Game Rules

Each team (of two or three) must act out the term they select without saying the word or its definition. Additionally, the following rules apply:

- Silently mouthing the words or letters is not allowed
- Draw on the board (no words but numbers are allowed)
- Make sounds or noises (again, no sounding of words)
- Make gestures, including nodding is allowed

Once the correct guess has been made, the team who acted out the term must say what the term means and then add a short description of the term to this README under the next section. Both the acting team and the team who guessed the term correctly, will get a point. The top scoring team will receive a prize.
