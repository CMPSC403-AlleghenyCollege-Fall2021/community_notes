## Linux Fundamentals

### In Fundamental Linux walkthroughs, name three linux commands you already knew and have regularly used before starting the walkthrough. *

cd, ls, touch

### In Fundamental Linux walkthroughs, describe three linux commands you have not previously used before starting the walkthroughs. Provide the command and give a short description of its purpose (what does it do).

nano (a terminal based text editor), wget (gets a file over the web (I think it's http?)), ssh (While I have used this before, I have never used it through the terminal exclusively. Securely connects to another computer). Also I have never used pipe operators, or at least not knowingly (> and >> which are for piping output to another command).

### What are the challenges you have experienced during the Linux Fundamentals walkthroughs?

Issues with the virtual machines not starting, permission errors, and lack of proper explanations/clear questions for some of the sections.
