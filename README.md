In Fundamental Linux walkthroughs, describe three linux commands you have not previously used before starting the walkthroughs. Provide the command and give a short description of its purpose (what does it do).

1. vim: which was used for accessing a text editor through the terminal window
2. su: which is used to switch between users within the virtual machine
3. ps: which displays the running processes of a users session
