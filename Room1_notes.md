## Shells

# What is a shell?

A shell is what we use when interfacing with a Command Line Environment. One can obtain access to a shell from an application running on the server to execute arbitrary code in that application's shell.

Reverse shell: forcing remote server to send us command line access to the server
Bind shell: opening up a port on the server which we can connect to in order to execute further commands
