## Firewalls: Activity 16

A firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. Various types of firewalls exist, including:

- **stateless(JJ):** basic packet filtering alrchitecture that implements a simple checkpoint at a traffic router or switch, checking the packet and either passing it or dropping it.
- **stateful(JJ):** monitors the full state of active network connections, analyzing the complete context of traffic and data packets rather than discrete traffic and data packets in isolation.

- **Virtual/Cloud(MK,MM,RH,TP,MC):** Cloud based firewalls are software based and specifically used in environments where deploying hardware firewalls can be difficult or impossible. Virtual firewalls grant or reject network access to traffic flows between various zones. They enable organizations to secure their expanding network perimeter to ensure secure access to assets.
