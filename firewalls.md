## Firewalls: Activity 16

A firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. Various types of firewalls exist, including:

- **stateless(JJ):** basic packet filtering alrchitecture that implements a simple checkpoint at a traffic router or switch, checking the packet and either passing it or dropping it.
- **stateful(JJ):** monitors the full state of active network connections, analyzing the complete context of traffic and data packets rather than discrete traffic and data packets in isolation.

- **Next-generation Firewall(CJ/CK/CS):** Next-generation firewall (NGFW) is part of the third generation of firewall technology that can be implemented in hardware or software. It is capable of detecting and blocking sophisticated attacks by enforcing security policies at the application, port and protocol levels. (from *TechTarget*)
