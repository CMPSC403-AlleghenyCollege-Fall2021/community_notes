## Firewalls: Activity 16

A firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. Various types of firewalls exist, including:

- **stateless(JJ):** basic packet filtering alrchitecture that implements a simple checkpoint at a traffic router or switch, checking the packet and either passing it or dropping it.
- **stateful(JJ):** monitors the full state of active network connections, analyzing the complete context of traffic and data packets rather than discrete traffic and data packets in isolation.
